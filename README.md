## 1. Breadth-First Search (BFS) 
Definition: 
BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at a selected node (the "root") and 
explores all of its neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.  
Conisder the example:-<br> 
       <pre> ``` A <br>/ \ B C / \ \ D E F ``` </pre> 
BFS Traversal: Starting from node A, the BFS traversal would be:<br> 
A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F
